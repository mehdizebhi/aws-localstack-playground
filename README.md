# LocalStack Test Projects

This repository contains a collection of test projects designed to explore and experiment with various AWS services using [LocalStack](https://docs.localstack.cloud/). Each project demonstrates a specific AWS service or scenario in a local development environment, offering insights into service behavior and interactions without requiring a live AWS account.

## Current Projects

1. **Lambda and S3 Integration**
   - A REST API for uploading files to an S3 bucket using AWS Lambda written in Java 21.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed and running.
- [LocalStack CLI](https://docs.localstack.cloud/references/cli/) installed.

Stay tuned for more projects and scenarios to be added!
